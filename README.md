# UltraEdit Clone (HTML & CSS Only)
This is a **clone of the UltraEdit website**, built purely with **HTML and CSS**.  
It replicates the frontend design and layout but **does not include any backend functionality**â€”so the download buttons are non-functional.

## Features
- Responsive grid layout for different language downloads  
- Styled header, navbar, and footer similar to the official UltraEdit website  
- Professional-looking download buttons  
- Pure HTML and CSS, no JavaScript backend  

## Limitations
- No backend or server functionality  
- Download buttons are placeholders and do not actually provide files
